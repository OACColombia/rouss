Description: This package includes the functions to fit the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck State-Space model to time-series data published by Dennis & Ponciano (2014). It also includes fit of Exponential Growth State-Space model from Humbert et al. 2009. We used these functions with community science data of the eBird platform. Finally, we include the risk-based Viable Population Monitoring (or Population Viability Monitoring) to assess probability of (quasi)extinction of the population across time.
